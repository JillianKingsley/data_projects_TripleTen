This was the first Code Pudding I competed in. It was a group project for a contest designed to showcase what we've learned about creating stories with data in the form of visual essays from Tableau visualizations.

### Data
The data was one .csv file provided by TripleTen:
- `'spotify-2023.csv'`: Excel workbook with information on songs from 1930-2023 from Spotify. This information includes key, mode, release date, track name, acousticness, bpm, danceability, energy, ranking in Apple, Deezer, Shazam, and Spotify charts and playlists, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, streams, and valence.

### Description:
- 6 slide PowerPoint presentation
- Includes 5 Tableau visualizations.

### Process:
We first reviewed the data individually.
Next we met as a team and chose the dataset we would work with.
We each explored the data in Tableau by making our own visualizations in Tableau.
Then we met again and chose the visualizations and story we would use for our visual essay.
I edited the visualizations for readability and visual appeal.
We worked together to write our presentation script.
Lastly, one of my teammates recorded the presentation.

### Findings:
1. Music streamed most between 2020-2023 in C# Major had an average positivity or valence rating of 53% out of a range from 38-62%.			
2. Music streamed most between 2020-2023 in C# Major had an average energy rating of 69% out of a range from 45-72%. 	
3. Music streamed most between 2020-2023 in C# Major had an average danceability rating of 70% out of a range from 63-74%.			
4. Music released in 2021-2023 ranged through almost every key and mode whereas music released in 2020 was more in keys in the minor mode.
5. The most popular key and mode in the Apple, Shazam, and Spotify charts from 2020-2023 was C# Major.
6. The most popular key and mode in the Deezer charts from 2020-2023 was G Major.
